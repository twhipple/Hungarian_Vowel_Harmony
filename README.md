## Hungarian_Vowel_Harmony

In this Repo I will attempt to code one of the CodeWars Katas - Hungarian Vowel Harmony. This was a great kata. I like how it introduced me to a language concept that I was not familiar with and doesn't exist in English. Plus, I enjoyed how I was able to create this word ending using Python and coding!


## Task

Vowel harmony is a phenomenon in some languages. It means that "A vowel or vowels in a word are changed to sound the same (thus "in harmony.")" (wikipedia). This kata is based on vowel harmony in Hungarian.

Vowel Harmony Rules (simplified)
When the last vowel in the word is

a front vowel (e, é, i, í, ö, ő, ü, ű) the suffix is -nek
a back vowel (a, á, o, ó, u, ú) the suffix is -nak

Preconditions:
To keep it simple: All words end with a consonant :)
All strings are unicode strings.
There are no grammatical exceptions in the tests.


## Examples:

Your goal is to create a function dative() which returns the valid form of a valid Hungarian word w in dative case i. e. append the correct suffix nek or nak to the word w based on vowel harmony rules.

dative("ablak") == "ablaknak"
dative("szék") == "széknek"
dative("otthon") == "otthonnak"

Thank you to Codewars for helping me practice my Python skills.
